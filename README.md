# C# Tutorials Authoring Application Developed for Cyryx College, Maldives

This is a stand alone (not web) C# application for authoring and running tutorials, which I developed in 1975 for my employer, Cyryx College of Maldives, and the code is therefore owned by them. It's provided here as an example of my work, with their permission.

It's not "professionally done" and something of a hack in many respects, owing to the fact that I was the only programmer who worked on it, and probably ever would work on it. I was "course director" at Cyryx, responsible for academic planning and supervision, and developed it on my own initiative as a prototype demonstration of how computer-based tutorials could be developed. After I left they had no desire to continue developing of it, as they decided they would use standardized packages for such things in the future rather than maintain their own code.
